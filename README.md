# QuoteVault 🔐

A full-featured Quote Discovery app built with **React Native (Expo)** and **Supabase**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Authentication:** Secure Email/Password login via Supabase.
- **Discovery:** Infinite scrolling feed of quotes.
- **Search:** Filter by category (Love, Success, Wisdom) and keyword search.
- **Collections:** Save favorite quotes to a personal collection (Cloud Sync).
- **Sharing:** Generate beautiful images of quotes to share on Instagram/WhatsApp.
- **Notifications:** Daily "Quote of the Day" reminders.

## 🤖 AI Workflow (How I Built This)

I used an AI-first approach to complete this 4-hour assignment in record time.

**Tools Used:**

- **ChatGPT / Claude:** For generating the Supabase SQL schema and complex logic (Auth/Search).
- **Cursor IDE:** For rapid code refactoring and bug fixing.
- **Expo Router:** For handling navigation structure.

**Key Prompts:**

> "Generate a Supabase RLS policy that allows users to only delete their own favorites."
> "Create a React Native ViewShot component to capture a view as an image for sharing."
